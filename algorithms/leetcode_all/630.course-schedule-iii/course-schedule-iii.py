# idea:
# sort all courses by deadline
# iterate all sorted courses
# if current course is able to be taken, then take it
# if not, check if we can remove some courses from courses we already taken
# if the one has the maximal duration is greater than current course's duration
# then replace it by current course
# since courses are already sorted by deadline, then our new deadline must be later
# (why? because sorted by deadline, current deadline must be later than all deadlines of taken courses, 
# so it must be valid)
# moreover, we have more available time for taking more courses
